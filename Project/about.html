        <h2>Our Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            SummarAIze <br>
            Objective: Develop a text summarization tool to efficiently extract key information from
            large bodies of text, such as articles or research papers, enhancing readability and
            comprehension. <br>
            Deliverables: 
            AI text summarization model trained on MERN stack architecture.
            User-friendly web interface for inputting text and viewing summaries.
            Integration with external APIs for retrieving and processing text data.
            Deployment on a scalable server infrastructure for real-time summarization. <br>
            Requirements: <br>
            ● MERN stack application for front-end and back-end development. <br>
            ● Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries for text analysis. <br>
            ● User authentication and session management for personalized usage. <br>
            ● Database integration for storing summarized texts and user preferences. <br>
        </p>
